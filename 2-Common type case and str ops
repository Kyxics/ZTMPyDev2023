# Snake case
No spaces, Case Sensitive, typically replaces spaces with underscores, do not overwrite keywords.
Will start with either a lowercase or an underscore
Eg. snake_case; _foo_bar;

# Constants
Double underscores will be used on either side of the variablbe.
Commonly read as "do not touch" once defined

# Escape characters
Example statement:
sentence = 'It's "kinda" sunny outside.'
If print(sentence) is attempted, it'll error out.

"It's" contains a single quote being used as the string quotations in the form of the apostrophy.
"kinda" is going to be seen as a string as well.
To force that to be read as part of the string, a backslash \ (escape character) is used right before the character.

sentence = 'It\'s \"kinda\" sunny outside.'

"\t" can be used to add a tab.
Eg.
sentence = '\tIt\'s \"kinda\" sunny outside.'
print(sentence)

Will yield:
<    It's "kinda" sunny outside.>

Similarly, "\n " will add a new line
sentence = 'foo\nbar'
print(sentence)

Will yield:
<foo
bar>
