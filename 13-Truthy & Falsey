# When something is evaluated as a boolean TRUE, this 'something' is described as truthy.
# Conversely, if it returns a boolean FALSE, this is described as falsey.
# This is commonly accepted as Py handles a lot of True/False evaluation in the backend, and also adds some conveniences.

Example:
age = 18
country = 'USA'

if bool(age) and bool(country):
    print("You can drive but not drink.")
    
# This works not because us humans recognize the driving age of USA, but merely because:
#   bool(age) -> "does the variable 'age' have any value?"
#   bool(country) -> "does the variable 'country' have any value?"
# In both cases, it does not matter what is there so long as the value is not None - i.e. anything will do.

# This is noted as there are uses cases where one simply wants to ensure something is present, regardless of what it is.
