# Program to guess your age based on year of birth input.
=============================
### Using Datetime
# Will fail in use case where input is not numerical

from datetime import datetime as dt

current_year = int(dt.now().year)
birth_year = int(input('What year were you born?'))
guess = current_year - birth_year
print(f'You are approximately {guess} years old.')
=============================
### No imports
# Again will fail if non numerics are used.

birth_year = int(input('What year were you born? Eg. 1914: '))
current_year = int(input('What year is it right now? Eg. 1914: '))
guess = current_year - birth_year
print(f'You are approximately {guess} years old.')
=============================
# Note covering all use/edge cases (such as full verbose years) will get more complex.
# Regex and matching will be required.
